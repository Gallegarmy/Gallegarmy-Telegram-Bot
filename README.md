## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Dependencies specified in the `pyproject.toml` file

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository to your local machine:**

2. **Install the necessary dependencies using `uv`**: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/

   First, install `uv` if you havenâ€™t already:

   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

   Then, install the project dependencies with `uv`:

   ```bash
    make install
   ```

   OR

   ```bash
    uv sync --frozen
   ```

3. **Configure the bot with your Telegram token. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following line:**

```bash
BOT_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

4. **Run the bot using `uvicorn`:**

```bash
uv run main.py
```

## Commands

**General Commands:**

- **/start**: Sends a welcome message when a user initiates a conversation with the bot. Used to verify that the bot is functioning.

- **/beer**: Provides information about the next "AdminCaÃ±as" event, our monthly social gathering (First Friday of each month ðŸ˜‰).

- **/pineapple**: Sends a fun message about pineapple, considered a tropical delicacy by some.

- **/help**: Displays a list of all enabled commands in the bot, providing a quick guide for users.

- **/holidays**: Informs about the next holiday in Galicia. This command accepts an optional parameter (str) to indicate a specific department and get details about regional holidays.

```bash
/holidays Arteixo
```

**Karma Commands:**

- **/kup [user]**: Increases the karma of a user or thing by one. Ideal for recognizing good actions or comments.

```bash
/kup @Qrow01
```

- **/kdown [user]**: Decreases the karma of a user or thing by one. Used to mark inappropriate behavior or comments.

```bash
/kdown Java
```

- **/kshow [user]**: Displays the current karma level of a specific user or thing.

```bash
/kshow @Qrow01
```

- **/klist**: Shows a ranking of users and things with the most and least karma, allowing you to see who is most (or least) appreciated in the group.

**Menu Commands:**

(These commands are only enabled for the 'Food Orders' channel, which remains closed until the day of AdminCaÃ±as. If you want to adapt this bot for your own purposes, modify the `FOOD_THREAD_ID` in `dinner.py` with your own thread ID.)

(Administrators must start the dinner for these commands to be enabled.)

- **/order [id_number]**: Allows users to order a menu item based on a provided identification number. An additional number (int) can be provided as a second argument to order more than one item.

```bash
/order 23 2
```

- **/beer**: Adds a beer to the account of the user sending the command. This command is useful for splitting the bill at the end of an event, thanks to the idea of @jjqrs.
